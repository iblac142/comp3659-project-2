Each function* should have a block comment with three components:
  1. Concisely describe the purpose of the function
  2. List and describe each of the parameters
  3. Describe the possible return values

Inline comments are to be used when:
* The precise function or purpose of a piece of code is not immediately apparent
* It is helpful in letting a human reader understand the current state of the program
* The coder believes it to be otherwise helpful

Predefined constants are to be in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

Function names and struct members are to be in snake_case.

Variable names are to be in camelCase.

*Excluding getter and setter functions, which ought to be self-explanatory.
